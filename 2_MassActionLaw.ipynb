    "The __Mass Action Law__ describes how a chemical reaction takes place under ideal conditions. In brief, it is based on the fact that the speed of any reaction is proportional to the concetration of the reactants involved, which has been discussed previously in this course (te proportionalinty constant is the kinetic rate constant). From here, it follows that the rate of change of any reactant is also proportional to the concetrations of the reactants involved. This velocity depends on the affinity of the reaction and the concentrations of each of the reactants (in any scheme of interactions, the ones at the left of the arrow). The affinity of the reactions is defined by the rate constant `k` of the reaction. The `k` is the proportionality constant that correlates the speed fo the reaction with the concentrations of the species involved, which in this case are $X_1$ and $X_2$:\n",

    "The __Law of Conservation of Mass__ or __principle of Mass Conservation__ states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy, the mass of the system must remain constant over time, as the system's mass cannot change, so quantity can neither be added nor be removed. Therefore, the quantity of mass is conserved over time. For example, in chemical reactions, the mass of the chemical components before the reaction is equal to the mass of the components after the reaction. Thus, during any chemical reaction and low-energy thermodynamic processes in an isolated system, the total mass of the reactants, or starting materials, must be equal to the mass of the products. \n",

    "The __Law of Mass Action__ or __Mass Action Law__ was initially derived in the context of chemical reactions, it can be used also to describe the equilibirum of any system of interacting entities (rabbits and foxes, bacterias and T cells, genes and proteins, humans...).\n",
    "\n",
    "In brief, it allows us to calculate the dynamics of a set of interacting entitites of a system, and ic constitutes the most widely used tool to study biological systems from a quantitative predictive perspective. When possible, the __Mass Conservation Law__ allows us to reduce the complexity of the system by reducing the number of independent variables of the system of equations derived from the Mass Action Law, by providing us with dependencies between the variables of the system, allowing us to simplify the system and reduce the number of equations to solve. This search for mass conservation laws becomes more useful once whe have systems of more that one reversible reactions. "
