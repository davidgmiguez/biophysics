    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Law of Mass Action states that that the change in the amount of a given species that is part of a scheme of interactions with other species is proportional to the product of the amount of the interacting substances.  The Law of Mass Action allows us to derive the set of ODEs that govern the dynamics of a system of “interacting entities”. Lets define some species `A`, `B`, `C` and `D`  that interact between them, so the amount of each one is allowed to  change over time until the reaction comes to an end. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some possible schemes of interaction are, for instance:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "A + B  &\\overset{k_1}{\\longrightarrow} C  \\tag{1} \\\\ \n",

    "AB + C  &\\overset{k_3}{\\longrightarrow} AC + B   \\tag{3} \\\\ \n",
    "AB + CD  &\\overset{k_4}{\\longrightarrow} AC + BD   \\tag{4} \\\\ \n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the Law of Mass Action was initially derived in the context of chemical reactions, it also describes the dynamics of any interacting entities in a system (chemicals, proteins, genes, cells, organisms…).  "
